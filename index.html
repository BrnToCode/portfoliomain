                    <p>A friend in need is a friend indeed, that is the definition of a true friend who will never leave you during your hardships, success, and failure. We can choose our friends. Real friends always share and support each other. They feel joyful when we are happy, and during our sadness, they also share sadness with us. True friendship is all about sharing things, making mistakes, fighting for silly things, but again hugging to support each other. Friendship is an essential thing for a happy life. Whenever you are in worry, a chat with a friend takes out all problems away. That is the strength of friendship.</p>
